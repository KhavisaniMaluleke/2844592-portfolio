In this lab, I learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage a project using version control. I practiced creating a repository, cloning it locally, working with branches, and merging changes back into the main branch. I also learned the importance of writing clear and descriptive commit messages. Additionally, I gained experience using semantic HTML5 elements to structure a portfolio webpage and deploying it using GitHub Pages.
